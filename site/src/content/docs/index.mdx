title: Introduction

smartkit is a react library that allows you to connect to the sui network in a simple way.

It includes two core packages:

- `@heapup/smartkit`
- `@heapup/smartkit-hooks`

## @heapup/smartkit-hooks

Built on `@mystan/sui.js` and `@mysten/wallet-standard`, these React hooks provide functions such as connecting to a wallet, querying on-chain data, and sending transactions.

## @heapup/smartkit

It's a connection modal based on `@heapup/smartkit-hooks`. Can be easily integrated into your dapp.

## analogy

If we analogize smartkit to the Ethereum network

- `@heapup/smartkit` just like [rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) or [web3modal](https://web3modal.com)
- `@heapup/smartkit-hooks` just like [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh)
- `@mysten/sui.js` just like [viem](https://viem.sh)

So, you can use `@heapup/smartkit-hooks` to build your own connection modal.
